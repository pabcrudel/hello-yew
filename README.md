# Hello Yew

Web App made in `Rust` with [Yew](https://yew.rs/)

## The reason behind this project

I just started learning `Rust` and I read on their website that you can [build
WebAssembly with it](https://www.rust-lang.org/what/wasm). I searched on
the internet and I found `Yew`, a framework to do so in a way that reminds me
of React. So i decided to take a look.
